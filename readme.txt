This is a simulation of the adaptive cruise control technology using simulink. To run this simulation, look at the 3D animation of the technology in action using blue and red cars travelling on the highway. What you will see is that the blue car - with the adaptive cruise control - slows down to the same speed as the red car. The blue car has a controller which uses model predictive control to adjust the speed accordingly. For more questions about this technology, please contact kgeor040@uottawa.ca
